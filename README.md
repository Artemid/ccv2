Community Core Vision 2.0
=====================

Introduction
------------
nuiFramework is a cross platform/cross device framework for rapidly creating and testing interaction scenarios in natural user interfaces. 
It allows for general purpose signal processing from multiple sensor sources and processing them into global events and actions. 
Each platform will have its own specific runtimes and communication methods dependent on best available options. 
Our first implementation will be focused on Computer Vision (CCV).
